/*
 * 1. Interfaces Define Behavior, Not Implementation
 * A class is a blueprint for creating objects, containing both data (fields/variables) and methods .
 
* An interface is purely a contract that defines behavior but does not provide implementation (except default/static methods in Java 8+).

  * 2. Multiple Inheritance Support
* Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes to avoid ambiguity.
